I did not design these labs. All credit for lab design to Jeremy McDowell of Jeremy's IT Lab (YT)

All files were built in Eve-NG CE 6.2.0-4

Though switch icons are different from lab to lab, all are the same Cisco Layer 3 switch image.
Labs will be loaded to this repository as they are completed.
If you would like help converting a packet tracer lab to Eve-NG, please reach out.

IMPORTANT:
When resetting a lab, it is necessary to STOP and WIPE all nodes. If you do not wipe the node,
it will not load the default startup-config file.
